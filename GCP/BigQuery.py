BigQuery's core architecture decouples storage and compute, meaning these components operate and scale independently.


Storage :
BigQuery storage is a fully managed, durable, and highly available service that uses a proprietary columnar format (Capacitor) optimized for fast analytical queries. 

Compute :
The compute layer is responsible for executing SQL queries using Google's distributed query processing engine, Dremel









Yes, that is an accurate and concise description of Google BigQuery. 
Key characteristics summarized:
Fully managed: Google handles infrastructure maintenance, patching, and administration [1].
Serverless: Users don't need to manage physical or virtual servers [1].
Enterprise data warehouse: It's designed for large-scale data storage and analytics [1].
Decoupled architecture: Its unique design allows compute resources (for querying) to scale independently from storage resources
