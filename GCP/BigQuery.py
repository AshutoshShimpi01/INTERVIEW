BigQuery's core architecture storage and compute, meaning these components operate and scale independently.


Storage :       ( BigQuery storage, uses a columnar format optimized for fast analytical)
BigQuery storage is a fully managed, durable, and highly available service that uses a columnar format (Capacitor) optimized for fast analytical queries. 

Compute :    (Compute executing SQL queries using distributed query processing engine)
The compute layer is responsible for executing SQL queries using Google's distributed query processing engine, Dremel









Yes, that is an accurate and concise description of Google BigQuery. 
Key characteristics summarized:
Fully managed: Google handles infrastructure maintenance, patching, and administration [1].
Serverless: Users don't need to manage physical or virtual servers [1].
Enterprise data warehouse: It's designed for large-scale data storage and analytics [1].
Decoupled architecture: Its unique design allows compute resources (for querying) to scale independently from storage resources
